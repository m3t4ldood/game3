## Black Ops III: CODE TESTER
this is a crude replica of The Black Ops III Code Vault where you enter a word and it displays the total word value + what the word unlocks.

## Letter to Number Conversion App

## Overview
The "Letter to Number Conversion App" is a simple JavaScript application that allows users to convert a word into its numeric representation based on the position of each capital letter in the English alphabet. For example, A=1, B=2, C=3, and so on. The app also calculates the total word value by summing up the numeric values of all the capital letters in the word.

## Features
- Text Input Field: Users can enter a word in the text input field.
- Conversion Button: By clicking the "Convert" button, the app converts the word to its numeric representation and calculates the total word value.
- Result Display: The converted word and its total value are displayed on the web page.

## Implementation
The app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here's a brief description of the implementation:

### HTML
The HTML file contains a simple layout with a label, a text input field, a "Convert" button, and a paragraph element to display the result.

### JavaScript
The JavaScript code handles the following tasks:
- Retrieving the user input from the text input field.
- Converting the input text to uppercase to ensure consistent processing of capital letters.
- Calculating the word value by iterating through each character in the input word, checking if it's a capital letter (A-Z), and adding its numeric value to the total.
- Displaying the converted word and its total value on the web page.

## Usage
1. Open the "index.html" file in a web browser.
2. Enter a word containing capital letters in the text input field.
3. Click the "Convert" button.
4. The app will display the converted word and its total value based on the letter-to-number conversion.

## Limitations
- The app only considers capital letters (A-Z) for the conversion, ignoring lowercase letters and special characters.
- Non-alphabetic characters (e.g., numbers, symbols) are ignored during the conversion process.

## Future Improvements
- Support for lowercase letters and special characters for a more comprehensive conversion.
- Option to choose different numeric representations for letters.
- Error handling for invalid inputs and edge cases.

Feel free to use, modify, or enhance the app according to your requirements. Happy coding!
